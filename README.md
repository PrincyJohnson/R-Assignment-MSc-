# R-Assignment-MSc-
This is R shiny coding file for an assignment which was given in my Master's course. I am uploading this for the current students in UK or anywhere studying Bioinformatics. This will be helpful.

Questions:
1. Read in the data to the interface with minimal guidance.
2.  Run t-tests across all 10 genes comparing patients with disease against healthy controls, you 
can assume equal variance/unpaired in the t.test() function.
3. Plot a heatmap of the gene expression levels to assist interpretation.
pheatmap package is used.
4. If the combined genes are to be of use as a diagnostic test, the t-tests for all 10 genes are 
required to be significant at a p-value < 0.05 (disease positive). If one or more t-tests are no
significant, the diagnostic test will be classed as disease negative. Output a final automated 
statement reporting whether the diagnostic test is disease positive or disease negative.
